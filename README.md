A simple task list website that will manage tasks.

Tasks will be saved in the database securely. Users can delete or add their tasks in a single click and on the page itself without being redirected anywhere.
They can register and login with the password they will create. 
The passwords isn't stored in the database but is hashed so the accounts are completely secured.

After registering, they can start adding their tasks. The first task they add will be at the top along with the date the task was added.

The site also displays the current day. There is also an option for dark mode for the home page which stays on even after reloading the page until the option is clicked again.
